# 🚀 DEEP CLEAN Website - Wix Deployment Guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ **Files Ready for Deployment:**
- **index.html** - Homepage with hero section, testimonials carousel
- **about.html** - Team information, service areas, business details  
- **services.html** - Cleaning packages with Australian pricing
- **gallery.html** - 22 residential photos, testimonials carousel
- **contact.html** - Quote form with photo upload capability
- **styles.css** - Complete responsive styling (2,297 lines)
- **script.js** - Interactive functionality, photo upload, email integration
- **assets/** - All images, logo, team photos, gallery photos

### ⚠️ **Important Wix Considerations:**

#### 1. **Photo Upload Feature** 
- **Issue**: Wix may not support the ImgBB API integration for photo uploads
- **Solution**: Consider using Wix's built-in form submission with file uploads
- **Alternative**: Keep the photo preview functionality, remove cloud upload
- **Note**: The photo upload demo works perfectly in standalone HTML

#### 2. **Custom JavaScript**
- **Wix Limitation**: Custom JavaScript may be restricted in Wix editor
- **Solution**: Use Wix Corvid (now Velo) for advanced functionality
- **Fallback**: Basic forms work without advanced JavaScript

#### 3. **Email Integration**
- **Current**: Uses mailto links (works in Wix)
- **Enhancement**: Wix forms can send emails directly to business email
- **Recommended**: Use Wix's native form submission for better integration
